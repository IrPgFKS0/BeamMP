# BeamMP LAN fork — release downloads

**Current release: `BeamMP-LAN-p13h101.zip`** (mod `4.22.2-LAN p13h101`, combined host exe `p13h43`, **for BeamNG 0.39.x**
(validated on 0.39.4), Windows + Linux x86-64).

Downloads moved to **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/IrPgFKS0/BeamMP/releases)** — the zips
are no longer committed to this folder (each added ~20 MB to the repo's history forever; the
already-committed ones remain in history at their tags).

**Mod-only drop-in over p13h99** — the exe is unchanged (`p13h43`), so on p13h99 only `BeamMP.zip`
changes; coming from anything older, update both files. New mod `BeamMP.zip` sha256
`5AAEF4D416F9B7A58C6E7677CA766CD0D4835538B4218DDD8E5C725824C59B10`.
This build stops BeamNG deleting another player's car when it cannot find a clear spot for it. The
car used to vanish with a Lua error and stay missing until its owner respawned; now it appears where
it was placed (briefly overlapping something, in a genuinely packed spot) and position sync moves it
into place. The same protection covers a car swapped for a different model. If BeamNG cannot set a
remote car up at all, the mod no longer leaves your own next spawn unsent, and that car can be
retried from the player list's Restore. Verified in a two-player session (Windows host + Linux
client); the crowded-spot case itself did not come up there — see the release notes.
**Linux clients on anything older than p13h99:** the launcher could fail to find BeamNG (it searched
only the first Steam installation); p13h99 and later fix that. If you ran any p13h82–p13h85 build:
those reject every remote position packet in multiplayer (remote cars frozen) — update now.
(Superseded zips and their `lan-release-*` tags are removed as releases roll; the tags kept are
exactly the ones backing a published release -- currently `lan-release-p13h101`,
`lan-release-p13h99`, `lan-release-p13h98`, `lan-release-p13h96` and `lan-0.38-last-good` -- which is the set the AGPL
source promise needs. Every row in the table above must link a release that still exists, and the
source offer at the bottom must name a tag `git ls-remote --tags` actually shows.)

The zip contains:

```
BeamMP.zip                  the client mod (put next to the launcher exe on EVERY machine)
windows/BeamMP-Combined.exe one-process host: dedicated server + your own game bridge (--combined)
windows/BeamMP-Server.exe   plain dedicated server
windows/start-server.bat    host convenience launcher (+ pin-cores.ps1)
linux/BeamMP-Combined       same, Linux x86-64
linux/BeamMP-Server
RELEASE-NOTES.md            what's in this build (also in ../docs/lan/)
README-LAN.md               full setup / usage / profiling guide
LAN-TUNING.md               network + OS tuning, send-rate guidance
CachyOS_Install_LAVD.md     Linux client install + scheduler tuning
```

Quick start (host): unzip, run `windows/BeamMP-Combined.exe --combined` (or `start-server.bat`),
put `BeamMP.zip` next to the exe; players Direct-Connect to your IP on port `30814`.
Everyone in a session should run the matching `BeamMP.zip` **and** matching exe build.

Binaries are built from the `lan` branches of this repo and the companion repos
([BeamMP-Launcher](https://github.com/IrPgFKS0/BeamMP-Launcher),
[BeamMP-Server](https://github.com/IrPgFKS0/BeamMP-Server)) at tag `lan-release-p13h101`
(AGPL-3.0-or-later — complete corresponding source at those tags).
